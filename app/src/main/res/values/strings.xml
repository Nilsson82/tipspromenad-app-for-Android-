    This is the Tipspromenad app â€” a fun quiz app where you walk around and answer questions along the way. Perfect for events, team building, or just having fun with friends!
    &#10;&#10;Note: The app requires internet access because the questions are hosted on a webpage. If your phone does not support the app, you can also access the questions directly from the webpage:
